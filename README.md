# Structural Design Patterns in Modern C++

## From the Udemy course '**Structural Design Patterns in Modern C++**' by Umar Lone

## About
This code is my 'copy' for the code used in the Udemy course. If varies from the course provided code in a few ways:
* Written in CLion using CMake, instead of Visual Studio and MS Build.
* Written as one CMake project with separate executables for each design pattern.
* Written on Linux with Clang, instead of Windows with MSVC.
* Written using C++20 modules.

Some of it was written on Windows before the switch to Linux, with some code still written using Windows-only headers.
